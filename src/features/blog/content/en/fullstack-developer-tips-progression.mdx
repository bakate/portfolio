Hello amigos,

With nearly five years of experience as a fullstack developer, I humbly want to share a few tips that I hope can accelerate your progress in this demanding yet exciting field.

## 1. Prioritize Know-How Over Knowledge

As a developer, your primary added value lies in your ability to **solve concrete problems**. Theory is important, but it's by getting your hands dirty that you truly learn. The more you practice tackling technical challenges, the more you'll perfect your craft and develop your developer intuition. Every bug fixed, every feature implemented is a victory that builds your experience.

## 2. Cultivate the Skill of Learning to Learn

The world of web development evolves at a dizzying pace and especially with the advent of AI. Learning is therefore a continuous and inevitable process. You can never know everything, and that's not the goal. The key skill is to **learn how to find relevant information** when you need it. It's a bit like knowing how to drive: once you master the basics, you can drive most cars.

Similarly, while specializing in a language or framework, strive to understand the **fundamental concepts of programming** (data structures, algorithms, programming paradigms, design principles like SOLID, etc.). This deep understanding will allow you to approach any new language or technology with much more confidence and efficiency.

## 3. Aim for Simplicity and Practice Continuous Improvement

It's often tempting to want to create ultra-complex and sophisticated solutions from the outset. Resist this temptation! **Start simple**. Write clear, concise functions that do one thing well.

Then, **improve your code iteratively**. Refactoring is not a waste of time; it's an investment. Rely on **automated tests** as a safety net; they will give you the confidence to modify and improve your code without fear of breaking everything. And above all, ensure your code is **readable and understandable** by your peers (and by your future self!).

## 4. Fail Fast, Fail Often (and Learn!)

We're not launching rockets into space where failure has dramatic and financial consequences. In web development, failure is relatively inexpensive and, most importantly, it's an **extraordinary learning opportunity**. Every mistake is a lesson.

In fact, it's one of the few professions where, in France for example, the state implicitly encourages risk-taking and experimentation through schemes like the Research Tax Credit (CIR) and Innovation Tax Credit (CII).

In web development, learning by doing is absolutely essential. Focus on problem-solving, start personal projects, contribute to open-source projects, and never be afraid to fail. This is how we grow and thrive in this exciting field.
